# The Last LightKeeper

## Setting

In a world where the sun is dying and darkness has started swallowing the lands, ancient legends speak of a hidden sactuary - a place where the last light burns, guarded by the Lighkeeper. You, an ordinary traveler, stumble upon an old map pointing to its location. Your decisions will determine whether the world is saved, or lost forever engulfed in darkness.
